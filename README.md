# PortfolioPWA
> Building a Progressive Web App with Ionic 3.
This web app will be used as a Portfolio page with some cool features.

## Development

I'm using Jasmine and Karma, and getting more familiar with testing in a Ionic 3 project.
It's important to pay attention to the file structure of the project.

```bash
npm install -g karma-cli
```
